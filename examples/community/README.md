## Submitting A Template

- Add comments to whatever text, styles, or images that should be customized
- If you want your template to appear in the Unstoppable website builder, inline any styles that should be updated
- Make sure all relevant css & font files are included. Sites should be fully decentralized and not rely on any APIs for styles
- **Do not use any trademarked or copyrighted assets** without permission. If you want to use it, you have to ensure that you have the legal right to do so. If applicable add a footer with any necessary accreditation
